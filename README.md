# ShiftOnStack Edge Development Environment

For now, this is a very opinionated set of scripts that only work for Emilien's setup but
this is a prototype and a first iteration. We aim to move what we can into shiftstack/dev-install
and document the rest.

It contains scripts, dev-install overrides, TripleO envs & role, so we can deploy a low-footprint
OpenStack DCN environment using Standalone.
